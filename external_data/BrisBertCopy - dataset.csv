Did I tell you about the time in {{YEAR}}. It was the first time that I,I always wanted to have my own {{SEARCH_SUBJECT}}. Because I heard that,Which reminds me of {{SUBJECT}}. ,"But then again, I never did care much to talk about that topic. Some would say that it's a little bit uncouth, but when you think about it, just what is a couth anyway? Sorry, what were we saying?","But that's another topic. Like ironing your pants with a bowling ball, or {{SUBJECT}}.",I remember a young whipper snapper called Jeeves. Whatever happened to that guy?
"Let me tell you what happened in {{YEAR}}. You wouldn't know it, but","Don't look know, but you're sitting on a {{SEARCH_SUBJECT}}. It looks like the one that",And you couldn't feed your horse with a {{SUBJECT}}. No siree!,"But that's not to say that there's anything wrong with that. But I suppose if you think about it, who can say. ",I don't actually remember why I said that. I wanted to tell you about {{SUBJECT}}.,You know what's interesting? Onions. Who do you think  ate the first onion? They would have had to of been mighty hungry to take a bite out of that.
"Sit down and listen. Listen to a story. It's the year {{YEAR}}, and as you would expect",What do I know about {{SEARCH_SUBJECT}} you ask? Let me tell you. Whether you like it or not,"Fantastic, isn't it? Or ""sit around hot""-tastic as we called it. No one could afford to buy fans, you see. But we did once buy a {{SUBJECT}}.","It's pretty simple really, unlike my old neighbour's rules about cats. See having two cats in those days was a no-no. A cat and a {{SUBJECT}} was acceptable, mind you, as strange as that might seem to a city kid these days. We called that a full house. The kids from the bush called it ""a full horse"", and you can imagine the problems that caused. Anyway, where were we?",Don't look so surprised. It was common in those days. And so was {{SUBJECT}}.,"I was chatting to a lovely gent by the name of William Gates the other day. Something about painting his windows. Mark my words, it won't catch on."
"I don't know if you would remember this. It might be before you time, but in {{YEAR}} something amazing happened",I've been talking about {{SEARCH_SUBJECT}} for years. Nobody listens. So let me tell you all about it,"Yep. That's about what I remember about that. Not to be confused with {{SUBJECT}}, which is another thing entirely. ","And while I think about it, those were the good old days. You could still catch {{SUBJECT}} in the Brisbane River back then. Now it's just three pounds of brown. You don't even know what a pound is, do you? Anyway, what was I saying?","While I think about it, there's also {{SUBJECT}}. They were a shilling to the dozen.","You lot and your bridges, all this way and that way. Back in my day we just swam across the river. Of course nobody knew how to swim. Lost a lot of good friends back then."
"It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. Actually it was {{YEAR}}, and",Have you ever seen a {{SEARCH_SUBJECT}}? I saw one once that I will never forget,"You wouldn't believe it, would you? I certainly don't. Not since I heard about {{SUBJECT}}. ","But don't take my word for it. Ask Jeeves. What? Oh. Really? That's horrible. Poor guy. Well, I always said he talked too much. Anyway...",I remember when he and I found a {{SUBJECT}}.,I remember when King George Square was actually a circle. We changed it to stop people walking around and around and around.
Few remember the glory days around these parts. Including me. I'm old. But I can tell you about {{YEAR}}. It was,"Little Timmy gave me {{SEARCH_SUBJECT}} once. I didn't realise at first, but","That's just dandy. Like {{SUBJECT}}. That's pretty dandy too. Maybe three of four dandies if you were counting, and if you were, you would start with one dandy. Followed by two dandies. Three dandies would typically follow, and then you would have four dandies.","No trouble as all, as I always said. But I said a lot of things I guess. ","Dohickeywhatsits we called them, not a fangdangled {{SUBJECT}}.","CityCat? Ever tried to see a cat swim? Don't. They can't. Unless it's a catfish. In which case, never feed it an apple. Gets a taste for it you see, and will never leave you alone. "
"Gather around kids, and let me tell you about {{YEAR}}. Those were the good old days",You there. With the funny haircut. Did I tell you about the time that I had a {{SEARCH_SUBJECT}}? No? Good,"Fascinating. Well, interesting at least. A little boring, at most. Or mostly boring. Or... I don't even know what we're talking about anymore. What about {{SUBJECT}}? I can tell you all about that.","But wait a minute, you look bored. No? Just born that way? Okay, now don't get offended, it's probably just the haircut. Anyway, where were we? ",,Bali? New York? Back in my day a holiday was walking across the Nullabor. You moved into whatever city your shoes wore out in. 
Do you remember {{YEAR}}? I do. It was around this time that,"Kids these days. If it's not hippety hop or the dub steps, it's {{SEARCH_SUBJECT}}, or some such thing. And I don't like it","Not that you would know anything about that, with you face books and tweeters. I never had no tumbles in my day. Sure, we had a lot of {{SUBJECT}}, but that's another story.","Although now that I think about it, I'm not so sure. Hmmm. Let me come back to it. ",,"Old timers? Back in my day we just called them ""timers""."
It all happened in {{YEAR}}. It's actually a funny story you know. It begins with,"Have you ever been to {{SEARCH_SUBJECT}}? I Went there twice. Once by mistake, but the other time",Now I should probably ask if you would like some tea and biscuits? I should have some here somewhere. What's this? A {{SUBJECT}}? How did that get in there?,"So, to catch a possum, raccoons worked well. Three raccoons was called a round-up and that'd cost you a ginger short of a nickel. They'd give you garlic because ginger was scarce. Not enough possums digging for them you see, becuase of the raccoons.",,"New Farm? I remember when it was just Farm. Old man Norbert sowed chickens, as was the style at the time."
"I remember it well. The year was {{YEAR}}, and we tied onoins to our belt. As was the style of the time","Don't ask me about {{SEARCH_SUBJECT}}. I swore I would never tell. But now I think of it, it makes a good story, so listen up","Hang on. Wait. Who are you again? I don't want to sound rude, but do you have any identification? A passport? What about a license? Which reminds me of the time that I got my pilot's license. I cost me two diggetys and a {{SUBJECT}} for it.",,,I'm cold. And it tastes like blue.

,I don't like the look of that ROBOT. It reminds me of that kid that used to throw his baseball on my lawn. Best lawn in the city it was. Planted it myself. Planted the trees too. Gum trees they were. They grew so big that they blocked the sun and killed the lawn. I never liked that lawn. ,,,,
